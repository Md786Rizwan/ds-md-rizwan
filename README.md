## 🎯 Project Objective

Analyze the relationship between **trader behaviour** and **market sentiment (Fear & Greed Index)**:

- How do trade volume, volatility, win rate, and profitability change under Fear vs Greed?
- Are differences statistically significant?
- Can sentiment improve prediction of profitable trades?
- Can we model daily PnL using behavioural features?
